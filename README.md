I find this article interesting because it talks about Spotify branching out from its standard notion of B2C music streaming services
and actually developing tools for the broader software development landscape. A/B testing is important in the software development
process since it helps to identify the efficacy around the rollout of new features and whether the new feature drives further business
value and is well received by users. Also, it's easy for software developers to implement because the SDEs can integrate the platform
into their own technological infrastructure through APIs.
